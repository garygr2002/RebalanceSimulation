Inflation:		        1914-12 to 2021-12	Annual

S&P 500	Valuation:		1961-01 to 2022-06	Monthly

Suggest using:

1. Federal Funds, or Treasury Bill for cash investment yields
2. 10-year Treasury for bond yields, and bond investment price
3. S&P 500 Valuation for stock investment price
4. S&P 500 Dividend for stock yields
5. Alternate Inflation for inflation

Goal is a single library, indexed by year, month and first day of month.

Fields in a monthly data object will be:

1. S&P 500 Valuation at the start of the month
2. S&P 500 Valuation at the end of the month
3. S&P 500 Dividend yield at the start of the month
4. S&P 500 Dividend yield at the end of the month
5. 10-year Treasury at the start of the month
6. 10-year Treasury at the end of the month
7. Federal Funds on the 1st available day of the month
8. Treasury Bill average for the month
9. The rate of inflation

Simulation will run from 1962-01 to 2021-12.  The initial all-time high for
the S&P 500 appears to be: 72.64 on 12/12/1961, but instead use the 71.74 close
on 12/01/1961.  With an initial portfolio of $1,000,000.00 in January 1962,
you would need it to be worth $9,678,675.50 by January 2022 to have the same
value.  This is due to 867.9% inflation.

Suggested simulation parameters:
1. Discretionary withdraw between 0.03 and 0.049 annually, vary by 0.01 for 20
2. Fixed withdraw between 0.03 and 0.049 annually, vary by 0.01 for 20
3. Market high between 40.0 and 69.0 vary by 0.1 for 465 together with (4)
4. Market bear between market high plus one and 70 by 0.1 for 465 together with
   (3)
5. Advance threshold between 0.05 and 0.24 by 0.01 for 20
6. Decline threshold between -0.02 and -0.11 by -0.01 for 10
